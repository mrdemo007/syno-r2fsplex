# syno-r2fsplex

Plex built for Synology containing rar2fs. (did my best to optimize size)

OS: Ubuntu 18.04, Plex latest at container buildtime


needs:
 - /config mapped to folder containing the config for the container.
 - /transcode folder to use during transcoding.
 - /nomorerar for the folder containing your plex content.
 - run with high privs.
 
 Any optimization ideas welcome!
